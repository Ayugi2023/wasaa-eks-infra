# DISABLED: cert-manager Application disabled in repository
# Reason: TLS termination moved to AWS ALB + ACM wildcard certificate. This Application
# was preserved in git history if needed but disabled to avoid ArgoCD installing
# cert-manager by default. To re-enable, restore the original Application manifest
# or set the corresponding app-of-apps flag to true.
