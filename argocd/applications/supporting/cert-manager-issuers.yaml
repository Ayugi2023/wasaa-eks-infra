# DISABLED: cert-manager issuers Application disabled in repository
# Reason: issuer resources are no longer applied; TLS is terminated at ALB+ACM.
# Issuer resources were removed from environment directories to avoid accidental
# provisioning. Restore this file to re-enable issuing via cert-manager.
